# Plan: concert tickets and check-in at the door

Status: phases 1 and 2 are built (free seating, reservations paid at the Kasse, the online surcharge, check-in at the door). Written 2026-10-31. The public site (bachkreis-berg-de) sells through `/konzerte/karten`; this plan is about what sits behind it.

## 1. Where things stand

- **How tickets are sold today:** only on paper, in the school's Sekretariat before the concert and at the Abendkasse on the evening.
- **How seating works:** some concerts have reserved seats (Platzkarten), others free seating. Both must work.
- **What the public site has:** it shows the concerts from noten's feed (`/api/konzerte`) through a service binding. It has no sign-in and no database, and on purpose stores no personal data.
- **What noten already has:**
  - Sign-in, and rights given through groups in the "Rechte" tab (`src/lib/access/access.ts`).
  - D1 for the data the app writes itself (`migrations/`).
  - Mail (`src/lib/server/mail`) and rate limits (`rate_limits`).
  - An installable app that works offline.
  - Concerts from Google Calendar, which are the source of truth.

So the tickets live in noten, and the site is only the shop window.

## 2. Decisions to make first

| Topic | Proposal | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Payment** | Start with **reservations paid at the Kasse** (phase 1). Online payment comes later, as an option per orchestra, and is off by default. If it comes, **Wero** first: it's the cheapest card-free option. | Principle 3, "Nothing costs money": PayPal or Stripe take about 1.5–3 % of each sale. Wero through a payment provider costs about 0.77 % (Payone/Sparkasse) or 0.85 % + 5 ct (VR Payment, plus a monthly fee after the first year), as of October 2026. Bank transfer is free, but someone has to match payments by hand. |
| **Build or use pretix** | Build it only if the orchestra wants everything in one app. Otherwise use pretix: it's open source, has seat plans and a scanner app (pretixSCAN), and the hosted version charges a fee per ticket. | This is a real project, not a page: orders, cancellations, seat plans, a scanner and the legal texts. |
| **Who gets the ticket money** | The Förderverein or the school; the board decides. | It sets the name on the order confirmation, in the legal notice and as the payment receiver. |
| **Feature switch** | A new feature `tickets` that is **off unless a deployment turns it on** (`FEATURES_ON="karten"` or the preset). | Today every feature is on by default (`src/lib/features.ts`). Selling tickets has legal and payment consequences, so an orchestra has to choose it. |
| **Online surcharge** | Decided: online tickets cost the Kasse price **plus a surcharge** that covers the fees, set per concert as a percentage (rounded up to the cent) and/or a fixed amount per ticket. Free tickets stay free; tickets sold at the Kasse have none. | Transparent everywhere: the website, the confirmation mail and the ticket page show price and surcharge apart, and say what the surcharge is for. Each ticket stores its surcharge (`tickets.fee_cents`), so the organiser sees how much of the takings go to fees. |

## 3. Data (D1, new migration `0010_tickets.sql`)

The app writes all of this itself and nobody edits it by hand, so it belongs in D1, not in the sheet.

```sql
-- One row per concert that sells tickets. concert_id is the Calendar event id the feed uses.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ticket_sales (
	concert_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
	seating TEXT NOT NULL,              -- 'free' | 'reserved'
	capacity INTEGER,                   -- free seating: how many may come
	plan TEXT,                          -- reserved: the hall as JSON (rows, seats, aisles, wheelchair spaces)
	prices TEXT NOT NULL,               -- JSON: [{ type: 'adult', label, cents }]
	online_until TEXT NOT NULL,         -- online sales end here, e.g. two hours before
	open INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ticket_orders (
	id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                -- random
	concert_id TEXT NOT NULL,
	name TEXT NOT NULL,
	email TEXT,                         -- empty for sales at the Sekretariat or the Abendkasse
	channel TEXT NOT NULL,              -- 'online' | 'sekretariat' | 'abendkasse'
	status TEXT NOT NULL,               -- 'held' | 'reserved' | 'paid' | 'cancelled'
	held_until TEXT,                    -- seats held while someone is in checkout
	created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tickets (
	code TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- 128 random bits, base32: the QR code holds only this
	order_id TEXT NOT NULL,
	concert_id TEXT NOT NULL,
	seat TEXT,                          -- 'F 3'; empty for free seating
	type TEXT NOT NULL,
	cents INTEGER NOT NULL,
	checked_in_at TEXT,
	checked_in_by TEXT
);

-- A seat can only be sold once, even when two people click it at the same moment.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS tickets_seat ON tickets (concert_id, seat) WHERE seat IS NOT NULL;
```

- **No double sales:** the unique index is all the locking needed. Two buyers can't get the same seat, whichever Worker instance answers them.
- **Seats held during checkout:** a held order keeps its seats for 10 minutes. The existing job trigger (`src/lib/server/jobs/`) clears orders that expire.
- **Free seating:** a count per concert, checked against `capacity` in the same statement that inserts the tickets.

## 4. The pieces

### 4.1 Setting up a concert (organisers, laptop)

A new right, `karten.verwalten`, opens `/termine/[id]/karten`. There, an organiser:

- turns sales on, chooses free seating or a seat plan, and sets the prices and when online sales end;
- builds the seat plan from rows and seats per row, an aisle and wheelchair spaces. A plan can be saved per hall and reused, e.g. "Aula" or "Stadthalle";
- sees the sold, reserved and free counts, and can export the guest list.

### 4.2 Selling at the Sekretariat and the Abendkasse

A new right, `karten.verkaufen`, opens `/karten/verkauf`. It's the same seat plan, with the channel set to `sekretariat` or `abendkasse` and an optional e-mail address.

- The paper ticket gets the same QR code: the school prints it, or noten produces a PDF in the browser with `@cantoo/pdf-lib`, which noten already uses.
- Cash is entered as "paid". Nothing changes for the person at the till except that a phone or laptop replaces the ticket roll.

### 4.3 The public sale (site → noten)

The site reaches noten through the same service binding as the feed. The feed marks concerts with an open sale (`tickets: true`).

- `GET /api/karten/[concert]`: prices (Kasse price, surcharge and online price apart), seating and seats left. Cached for a few seconds and holding no personal data.
- `POST /api/karten/[concert]`: name, e-mail and the number of tickets per kind; places the reservation if it still fits and sends the confirmation. Built for free seating, so no hold step.
- Phase 3 (seat plans) adds the hold: `POST /api/karten/[concert]/halten`, then the order.

The buyer's tickets are at `/karte/[order]` on noten (the order id is 128 random bits), one QR code per ticket. The QR codes are drawn by noten itself (`src/lib/tickets/qr.ts`), without a library.

Abuse protection:
- rate limits through the existing `rate_limits` table: per caller, per buyer's e-mail and per concert;
- Cloudflare Turnstile (free) on the order, which the site already plans for its forms (not built yet);
- at most 10 tickets per order.

### 4.4 Check-in at the door

A new right, `karten.einlass`. The group "Einlass" gets it for the evening, and removing people from the group afterwards revokes it. The page is `/einlass/[concert]`, made for phones:

1. **Before the doors open**, still with reception, the page downloads every valid ticket code for this concert and keeps it in IndexedDB, with seat, type and name.
2. **Scanning:** the camera reads the QR code.
   - The browser's built-in `BarcodeDetector` covers Chrome on Android.
   - iPhones don't have it, so a small reader runs in the browser as a fallback. noten avoids runtime dependencies, so pick a WASM decoder that is loaded only on this page.
3. **Checking:** the code is looked up in the local list. The screen turns big and green ("Reihe F, Platz 3 · Erwachsene") or red ("Schon eingelassen 18:42" / "Unbekannt"), and the phone vibrates. Check-ins are written locally first.
4. **Syncing:** whenever there's reception, local check-ins go to `POST /api/einlass/[concert]` in batches, and the server returns the check-ins from the other phones.
   - Online, a ticket used at one door is rejected at the other.
   - Offline, two phones can admit the same code twice; it shows up after syncing. That's acceptable for a school concert.
5. **Without a code:** search by name, and admit by hand.
6. **Counter:** "312 of 400 in", for the fire-safety head count.

**Why the code is just a random number, not a signed one:** the list downloaded beforehand already proves a code is real, and a signature check on the phone would need either the secret on every phone or extra public-key code. 128 random bits can't be guessed.

### 4.5 Mails

- The order confirmation, with one QR code per ticket, goes through `src/lib/server/mail`.
- The wallet passes from the mock-up (Apple/Google Wallet) need signing certificates and a paid Apple developer account, so they are left out under principle 3. The mail and a PDF are enough.

## 5. Legal (have this checked before going live)

- **Privacy notice:** buyers aren't members. noten's privacy text needs a section on ticket orders that covers:
  - which data is processed: name, e-mail, the order and the check-in time;
  - the legal basis: Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR;
  - deletion: guest lists and check-ins, e.g. 30 days after the concert;
  - retention: accounting records, up to 10 years, § 147 AO.
- **Ordering, when payment is online:**
  - the button must say "zahlungspflichtig bestellen" (§ 312j BGB);
  - the price must include everything;
  - there's no right of withdrawal for events on a fixed date (§ 312g (2) no. 9 BGB), but the buyer has to be told that before ordering.
- **Legal notice and terms:** who sells the tickets (see §2), plus short terms of sale (cancellation if the concert is cancelled, no resale).
- **Data location:** create D1 with `--jurisdiction eu`, as `wrangler.toml` already recommends.

## 6. Phases

| Phase | Content | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The `tickets` feature, migration, organiser setup for **free seating**, online **reservation** (paid at the Kasse), confirmation mail with QR codes | A test concert takes reservations from the site's sale page and they appear in noten |
| 2 | **Check-in** at the door: offline list, scanner, sync, name search, counter | Two phones at two doors admit a test audience, one of them in airplane mode |
| 3 | **Seat plans**: hall editor, seat choice on the site, holds that expire | Two browsers can't book the same seat |
| 4 | **Sekretariat and Abendkasse** in noten: selling on the same plan, printed tickets with codes | The Sekretariat sells one concert only through noten |
| 5 (optional) | **Online payment**, per deployment and off by default, once the board has accepted the fees. Wero through the association's bank's payment provider (Payone at Sparkassen, VR Payment at Volksbanken); the association's bank account must be a business or association account | A test payment in the provider's sandbox marks the order as paid |

Phases 1 and 2 already replace the paper reservation list and speed up entry at no cost. Phase 5 is the only one that costs money.
